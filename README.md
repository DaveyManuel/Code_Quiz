## Description

In this project, I created a quiz of 10 questions using primarily JavaScript, and HTML. When a user answers a question correctly, they are awarded 10 points. At the end, the user is prompted for their name in order to record their score to show on the leaderboard.

## Usage
 
To use, click on each choice button and it will award you with 10 points if it is correct and move on to the next question. If the user answers incorrectly it will not award any points, but will still move on to the next question. 

## User Story

As a user, I want to take a quiz so that I am awarded points when I answer the question correctly.

## Motivation

The motivation for my project was to create a responsive quizlet that takes in user action and awards them for correct answers.
